            <h1 class="display-size page-title">About</h1>
            <div class="about-content">
                <p class="about-heading"><span class="italic">The About part</span></p>
                <p class="about-block">I’m a digital product designer. I am currently employed in the role of Associate
                    Creative Director, at <a class="in-page-link" href="https://www.rga.com/work"
                        target="_blank">R/GA</a>. Up until the pandemic I worked out of the
                    New York office (the “Airport”), whereas I now work out of the home studio that I share with my
                    amazing girlfriend in Brooklyn. I have been at R/GA for five years and change (almost half my time
                    residing in New York), working on Verizon. I grew up in Sydney, Australia.</p>
                <p class="about-block">I work with a team that handles systematic design, design guidance, internal
                    facing products and brand compliance. While at R/GA I'm placed in the Visual Design discipline, my
                    job can swing into UX, straight UI, and some management. There will be the odd "blue sky" project,
                    or "Vision" and they can be campaign or product focused.</p>
                <p class="about-block">My design journey is pretty windy (aren't they all). I studied photography at
                    University, but I had always liked tinkering with computers and gaming. I picked up a few freelance
                    design gigs, and that started to pay the rent. Eventually I moved into Flash Development, and was
                    lucky
                    enough to have a great mentor who taught me some basics of programming. When <a class="in-page-link"
                        href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/apr/29/steve-jobs-flash-ipad-letter-dead"
                        target="_blank">Flash died</a> I moved back
                    into design, but had a different POV: knowing how things worked helped me solve problems.</p>
                <p class="about-block">I don't sell myself as a programmer, but I can code pretty well. Understanding
                    HTML/CSS/JS and parts of React has helped me immensely in my design approach. I try to be methodical
                    and systematic, and apply principles of "Object Oriented Design". If I had ample time I would spend
                    more of it digging deeper into React, Vue, GLSL, three.js (or React-three-fiber!) and Unity (or
                    Unreal Engine). I get a pretty big dopamine hit learning new things!</p>
                <p class="about-heading"><span class="italic">How the site was made</span></p>
                <p class="about-block">I tried to make this site basically be the opposite of what I do day-to-day. The
                    Verizon guidance is very rigid, so I wanted this thing to be weirder. I chose <a
                        class="in-page-link" href="https://ohnotype.co/fonts/beastly" target="_blank">Beastly(72
                        Point)</a> by
                    OHNOTypeCo for some of the headlines (wanting to go for an absurd Western poster look), and I've
                    always loved Klim Type, and so set the body and UI in <a class="in-page-link"
                        href="https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/untitled-sans/" target="_blank">Untitled Sans.</a></p>
                <p class="about-block">The site itself is built in <a class="in-page-link"
                        href="https://www.semplice.com/" target="_blank">Semplice / Wordpress</a>. I basically use it as
                    an engine
                    for single page app transitions (it just works). To help iwith styling and interactions, I set up an
                    local prototype environment using
                    VSCode,
                    Vanilla JS, SASS, Gulp and Netlify. Semplice is great, but the code editor is not. Should you
                    choose the custom route in it, the workflow is difficult (but not insurmountable!). I'll most likely
                    use it as an
                    ongoing space to tinker and experiment.</p>
