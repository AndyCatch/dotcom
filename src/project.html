		<section class="about">
			<div class="about-content">
				<p class="about-heading"><span class="italic">The About part</span></p>
				<p class="about-block">I’m a digital product designer. I am currently employed as an Associate
					Creative Director, at <a class="in-page-link" href="https://www.rga.com/work" target="_blank">R/GA</a>. Up
					until the pandemic I worked out of the
					New York office <a class="in-page-link" href="https://www.hustwit.com/workplace" target="_blank">(the
						“Airport”)</a>, whereas now I work out of the home studio that I share with my
					amazing <del>girlfriend</del> wife in Brooklyn. I have been at R/GA for seven years or so (more than
					half my time residing in New York). My day-to-day client is Verizon. In the past when the economic
					outlook was
					more rosy, there was more flexibility to move between clients, and I've worked on Goldman Sachs,
					Sonic Drive-In and Magic Leap. I grew up in Sydney, Australia.</p>
				<p class="about-block">I work with a team that handles systematic design, design guidance, internal
					facing products and brand compliance. At R/GA I'm placed in the Visual Design discipline, my
					role can swing into UX (including UX writing), design operations or straight UI. There will be the
					odd "blue sky" project,
					or "Vision" and they can be campaign or product focused.</p>
				<p class="about-block">My design journey up to this point is pretty bendy (aren't they all). I studied
					photography at
					University, but I had always liked tinkering with computers and gaming. I picked up a few freelance
					design gigs, and that started to pay the rent. Watching my fellow classmates suffer in their
					photo-assistant "work-experience" roles solidified that maybe being a photographer wasn't for me. I
					was curious enough to move
					into Flash Development, and was lucky enough to have a great mentor who taught me some basics of
					programming. When <a class="in-page-link"
						href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/apr/29/steve-jobs-flash-ipad-letter-dead"
						target="_blank">Flash died</a> I was able to swing back
					into design (a credit to Flash's visual programming concept), but I had a different POV: knowing how
					things were built helped me solve visual design problems.</p>
				<p class="about-block">I certainly don't sell myself as a programmer, but I can code. I love to piece
					together parts of javascript to get a result. Tinkering can both increase knowledge and the time it
					takes to finish, but understanding HTML/CSS/JS and parts of React has helped me immensely in my
					design approach. I try to be methodical
					and systematic, and apply principles of "Object Oriented Design". If I had ample time I would spend
					more of it digging deeper into React, GLSL, three.js (or React-three-fiber!) and probably Unity or
					Unreal Engine. I get a pretty big dopamine hit learning new things!</p>
				<p class="about-heading margin-top-sixteen"><span class="italic">How the site was made</span></p>
				<p class="about-block">I tried to make this site basically be the opposite of what I
					do day-to-day. The
					Verizon guidance is very rigid, so I wanted this thing to be weirder. I chose <a class="in-page-link"
						href="https://ohnotype.co/fonts/beastly" target="_blank">Beastly</a> by
					OHNOTypeCo for some of the headlines, wanting to go for an absurd Western poster look, and I've
					always loved Klim Type, and so set the body and UI in <a class="in-page-link"
						href="https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/untitled-sans/" target="_blank">Untitled Sans.</a></p>
				<p class="about-block">The site itself is built in <a class="in-page-link" href="https://www.semplice.com/"
						target="_blank">Semplice / Wordpress</a>. I basically use it as
					an engine
					for single page app transitions (it just works). To help iwith styling and interactions, I set up an
					local prototype environment using
					VSCode,
					Vanilla JS, SASS, Gulp and Netlify. Semplice is great, but the code editor is not. Should you
					choose the custom route in it, the workflow is difficult (but not insurmountable!). I'll most likely
					use it as an
					ongoing space to tinker and experiment.</p>
