                <p class="about-block">I’m a digital product designer. I am currently employed as an Associate
                    Creative Director, at <a class="in-page-link" href="https://www.rga.com/work"
                        target="_blank">R/GA</a>. Up until the pandemic I worked out of the
                    New York office <a class="in-page-link" href="https://www.hustwit.com/workplace"
                        target="_blank">(the
                        “Airport”)</a>, whereas now I work out of the home studio that I share with my
                    amazing <del>girlfriend</del> wife in Brooklyn. I have been at R/GA for seven years or so (more than
                    half my time residing in New York). My day-to-day client is Verizon. In the past when the economic
                    outlook was
                    more rosy, there was more flexibility to move between clients, and I've worked on Goldman Sachs,
                    Sonic Drive-In and Magic Leap. I grew up in Sydney, Australia.</p>
                <p class="about-block">I work with a team that handles systematic design, design guidance, internal
                    facing products and brand compliance. At R/GA I'm placed in the Visual Design discipline, my
                    role can swing into UX (including UX writing), design operations or straight UI. There will be the
                    odd "blue sky" project,
                    or "Vision" and they can be campaign or product focused.</p>
                <p class="about-block">My design journey up to this point is pretty bendy (aren't they all). I studied
                    photography at
                    University, but I had always liked tinkering with computers and gaming. I picked up a few freelance
                    design gigs, and that started to pay the rent. Watching my fellow classmates suffer in their
                    photo-assistant "work-experience" roles solidified that maybe being a photographer wasn't for me. I
                    was curious enough to move
                    into Flash Development, and was lucky enough to have a great mentor who taught me some basics of
                    programming. When <a class="in-page-link"
                        href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/apr/29/steve-jobs-flash-ipad-letter-dead"
                        target="_blank">Flash died</a> I was able to swing back
                    into design (a credit to Flash's visual programming concept), but I had a different POV: knowing how
                    things were built helped me solve visual design problems.</p>
                <p class="about-block">I certainly don't sell myself as a programmer, but I can code. I love to piece
                    together parts of javascript to get a result. Tinkering can both increase knowledge and the time it
                    takes to finish, but understanding HTML/CSS/JS and parts of React has helped me immensely in my
                    design approach. I try to be methodical
                    and systematic, and apply principles of "Object Oriented Design". If I had ample time I would spend
                    more of it digging deeper into React, GLSL, three.js (or React-three-fiber!) and probably Unity or
                    Unreal Engine. I get a pretty big dopamine hit learning new things!</p>
                <p class="about-heading margin-top-sixteen"><span class="italic">How the site was made</span></p>
                <p class="about-block">I tried to make this site basically be the opposite of what I
                    do day-to-day. The
                    Verizon guidance is very rigid, so I wanted this thing to be weirder. I chose <a
                        class="in-page-link" href="https://ohnotype.co/fonts/beastly" target="_blank">Beastly</a> by
                    OHNOTypeCo for some of the headlines, wanting to go for an absurd Western poster look, and I've
                    always loved Klim Type, and so set the body and UI in <a class="in-page-link"
                        href="https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/untitled-sans/" target="_blank">Untitled Sans.</a></p>
                <p class="about-block">The site itself is built in <a class="in-page-link"
                        href="https://www.semplice.com/" target="_blank">Semplice / Wordpress</a>. I basically use it as
                    an engine
                    for single page app transitions (it just works). To help iwith styling and interactions, I set up an
                    local prototype environment using
                    VSCode,
                    Vanilla JS, SASS, Gulp and Netlify. Semplice is great, but the code editor is not. Should you
                    choose the custom route in it, the workflow is difficult (but not insurmountable!). I'll most likely
                    use it as an
                    ongoing space to tinker and experiment.</p>
