                <p class="about-heading">The About part (I hope you like scrolling)</p>
                <p class="about-block">I’m a designer. I am currently employed in the role of Design Director, at an
                    agency
                    called R/GA. It’s rather large, there’s a few offices about. Up until recently I worked out of the
                    New
                    York office (the
                    “Airport”), whereas now I work out of the home studio that I share with my amazing girlfriend. I
                    have
                    been at R/GA for nearly five years, almost half my time residing in New York. Oh, I didn’t mention
                    that
                    I’m from Sydney? Well I am. I work mostly on the challenging* Verizon account.</p>

                <p class="about-block">Design projects that come to me are usually systematic, with a bit of product
                    here
                    and
                    there.
                    Unsurprisingly, most of the work shown is Verizon. There’s some from Sonic Drive-in (which I worked
                    on
                    with the ATX office), some old stuff from Razorfish, and a few more bits and pieces, but yeah mostly
                    Verizon,
                    or “VZ” as we call it in the “biz” (no calls it the “biz").</p>
                <p class="about-block">At R/GA I’m in the “visual” design “discipline”, but due to the systematic nature
                    of
                    my work, it involves
                    about 25% UX, which can mean working alongside a UX designer, or just doing it myself. The
                    delineation
                    of
                    “visual” with design is flawed, however, I’m happy to run with it to pay the rent. It also involves
                    working
                    with tech quite a bit, so it’s handy that I can code. I can read and write the big three
                    (HTML/CSS/JS),
                    and
                    lately have been leaning into a bit of React which is fun. I’m no unicorn, but it’s fun as heck!</p>
                <p class="about-block">On a long enough timeline I could most likely code a more complicated site than
                    the
                    custom parts of this
                    one
                    (check out the clock yo!), I am usually a bit tired from my full-time job. But when I have downtimeI
                    love to
                    learn from the SuperHi team, the best place to skill up I’ve encountered imho. If I had endless
                    amounts
                    of
                    time I would improve my three.js, GLSL and Unity skills.</p>
                <p class="about-heading">More like “lolophon” amirite</p>
                <p class="about-block">Working within a strict design system like Verizon’s can be both limiting and in
                    a
                    way
                    illuminating; as Tom Sachs mentions in “Ten Bullets”, creativity is the enemy. There is a joy in
                    accutely understanding
                    boundaries in which to work. With that said... mostly Verizon work for five years does tend to
                    narrow
                    the
                    possibilities to Neue Haas Grotesk, black, white or red. Hence for my own site, I decided to go with
                    a
                    decidedly zany type choice of the wonderful Beastly by ONHOTypeCo and Beatrice by Sharpco. Throw in
                    a
                    garish
                    backdrop of an unfinished brutalist display letters of my own design, and it’s quite the antidote.
